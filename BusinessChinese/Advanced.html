                    The Advanced Business Chinese Classes with AEI-Intlingo Academy are for students who already have a solid knowledge of the Chinese language but require additional guidance in niche business areas. These lessons will enable students to communicate with native Chinese business clients and partners with complete ease.

                    Advanced areas of business language that can be covered in the advanced course include: legal terminology and regulations; language for business negotiation; advanced organizational structure; and language for public relations.

                    As with all of the AEI-Intlingo Academy Business Classes, these lessons can be tailored to the individual needs of the student, which is particularly relevant at the advanced level. Our expert teachers provide all of the tools that students of advanced business language require to communicate with Chinese businesspeople at the highest level.
