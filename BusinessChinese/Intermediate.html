                    Students who enroll for Intermediate Business Chinese Classes with the AEI-Intlingo Academy should have completed the Beginners course, or should already have a foundation in Business Chinese. Throughout these classes, students will build on the foundations of their existing Chinese in order to acquire Business Chinese at a more advanced, acquiring business terms, complex sentence structures, and grammar.

                    At the intermediate level, our experienced and qualified teachers will also introduce more complex business topics into lessons. These could include operations; cultural differences within the workplace; prices, profits, and accounting; and the supply chain.

                    As with all of our Business Chinese Classes, lessons can be structured to suit the individual language needs of students. If a student works as an accountant and has a particular requirement for financial terminology, this can be arranged.
