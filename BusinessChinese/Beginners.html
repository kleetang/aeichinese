                    Students who enroll in Beginners Business Chinese Classes with the AEI-Intlingo Academy do not require any prior Chinese language experience. Core concepts in the Chinese language are introduced to students while maintaining a business focus throughout all lessons.

                    In these lessons with our highly qualified teachers, students of Business Chinese will acquire Chinese language skills around basic business concepts such as: recruitment and how to apply for a job; being able to talk about products and services; how to arrange meetings; business telephone greetings.

                    These lessons can be entirely tailored to the business language requirements of a student. For example, if a student works in sales and requires a portfolio of Chinese sales language, this can be a focus of the lesson.
