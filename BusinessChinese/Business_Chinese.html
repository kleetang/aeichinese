                    The increasingly important role that China plays in global business means that acquisition of the Chinese language is in greater demand than ever before. At the AEI-Intlingo Academy we teach Business Chinese at all levels so that beginners can form a grasp of basic business terms and uses of language, while those students already conducting business with Chinese partners and clients will be given the tools to significantly enhance their communications.

                    Our teachers are not only specialists in conversational Chinese but also in advanced Business Chinese, and they adopt appropriate teaching techniques throughout classes to ensure retention of complex business terminology in the Chinese language. Whatâ€™s more, our classes can be tailored to the needs of individual students to ensure that classes focus on an area of language acquisition that is completely relevant to them.
