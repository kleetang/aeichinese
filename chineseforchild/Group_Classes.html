                    For children who are innately social and curious about other people, learning in a group class can be a fantastic way of acquiring the Chinese language. Through interacting with their peers while learning, young students are immersed in a fun experience that they will want to repeat again and again.

                    In our Group Chinese Learning Classes, students have a completely immersive and interactive experience. They will play group games with their peers, they will sing traditional Chinese songs with other students in the class, and they will be able to engage in real Chinese conversations with their classmates.

                    Enrolling children in our group classes is the best way of ensuring that they develop Chinese language skills while having fun and making friends in a safe and supportive environment.
