                    Our Private Chinese Learning Classes for children are ideal for young students who require an intensive and immersive learning experience. Through 1-to-1 teaching, children do not experience any of the usual distractions of a busy classroom and can concentrate on the task of learning the Chinese language.
                    
                    Choosing a private class also provides far more scope for tailoring language lessons to a particular child’s needs. If one child needs to pick up Chinese conversational speaking skills specifically, and another requires academic skills that will be applied mostly in reading and writing tasks, those individual requirements can be more successfully met through a private class.

                    What’s more, if a child has particular learning needs, these can be addressed more specifically within a private class in which a child is receiving a teacher’s complete attention. 

                    Private classes do not limit the fun of Chinese learning for young students, and teachers still use multimedia teaching techniques and games in order to engage young learners throughout private lessons.
