                    Not everyone has hours each day that they can dedicate to learning a new language. With the demands of school hours and hobbies, it can be difficult for children to find the time to acquire a new language.  With our weekend classes, Chinese language lessons can easily be structured around the demands of school and placed into weekly timetables.

                    Our weekend classes are immersive experiences that teach children the Chinese language while also introducing them to the world of Chinese culture and arts. Through creating poems, playing games, and listening to folk tales, our students take the opportunity to do something different with their weekends by exploring Chinese cultures and traditions.

                    Through learning with other children of the same age, our students quickly pick up conversational skills in Chinese while having fun and making new friends.
