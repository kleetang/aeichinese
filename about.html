						The AEI-Intlingo Academy is a new arm of American Education Center and its strategic partner Intlingo Global Language Solution, a full language solutions operation that has been in business since 1998. The Academy extends the remit of the organization by offering a range of Chinese language classes for students of all levels.
                	</p>
                	<p>
                		For beginners and advanced learners, and from lessons in business Chinese to conversational Chinese, the AEI-Intlingo Academy is dedicated to providing a comfortable space where students of all abilities can fulfill their potential as learners of a second language.
                	</p>
                	<p>
                		Whether a student requires the supportive nature of a group class or would prefer an intensive 1-on-1 experience, the AEI-Intlingo Academy can provide the appropriate learning environment. What’s more, our teachers are all highly qualified and experienced in teaching Chinese to English native speakers. Our teachers help our students to push themselves in lessons while also fostering a supportive environment for learning. AEI-Intlingo also hires a number of support staff to ensure that from signing-up for lessons to receiving a language learning certificate, the AEI-Intlingo experience is always gold standard.
                	</p>
                	<p>
                		There is no greater way to access all the wonder of Chinese culture than by learning the language. Sign up for a course with AEI-Intlingo Academy and all of your Chinese language learning needs will be met.
