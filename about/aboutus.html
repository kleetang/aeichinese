                The AEI-Intlingo Academy is a new arm of American Education Center and its strategic partner Intlingo Global Language Solution, a full language solutions operation that has been in business since 1998. The Academy extends the remit of the organization by offering a range of Chinese language classes for students of all levels.

                For beginners and advanced learners, and from lessons in business Chinese to conversational Chinese, the AEI-Intlingo Academy is dedicated to providing a comfortable space where students of all abilities can fulfill their potential as learners of a second language.
                <br><br>
                Whether a student requires the supportive nature of a group class or would prefer an intensive 1-on-1 experience, the AEI-Intlingo Academy can provide the appropriate learning environment. Whatâ€™s more, our teachers are all highly qualified and experienced in teaching Chinese to English native speakers. Our teachers help our students to push themselves in lessons while also fostering a supportive environment for learning. AEI-Intlingo also hires a number of support staff to ensure that from signing-up for lessons to receiving a language learning certificate, the AEI-Intlingo experience is always gold standard.
                <br><br>
                There is no greater way to access all the wonder of Chinese culture than by learning the language. Sign up for a course with AEI-Intlingo Academy and all of your Chinese language learning needs will be met.
