					<h1>Chinese For Children</h1> 
					<p>Young children are far more adept at learning new languages than adults. As adults, we have developed a range of habits and behaviors related to language that are hard to shake, but children can be receptive to complex new languages like Chinese, and pick up new linguistic patterns with greater ease. Introducing second language learning to a child at a young age can give them a great head start in life, and at the AEI-Learn Chinese we always make the learning process fun and age appropriate.</p>

					<p>Through a variety of teaching techniques, the AEI-Learn Chinese staff makes Chinese language learning a dynamic experience for young students of all abilities. We engage with traditional Chinese music and poetry to provide an engaging and interactive way of learning, but also to give our young students access to the rich world of the Chinese arts. Through listening to Chinese folk tales, students will develop their listening skills in Chinese and will get to hear some of the greatest stories ever told at the same time. We can also tailor classes to the interests of the child to make language acquisition that much easier. For example, lessons can be planned around interests in mathematics or history. Our classes are fun and colorful, but they also get to the heart of language learning. Our young students all learn conversational skills in Chinese that they will be able to apply day-to-day with Chinese speakers.</p>
