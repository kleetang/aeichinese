                    Private Chinese Classes for Adults at the AEI-Intlingo Academy provide a focused point of access to the Chinese language. Unlike group classes that are not designed to meet specific language needs of the individual, private classes can be completely tailored to both language proficiency and areas of interest.

                    Private Classes are ideal for both beginners and advanced language learners alike. For beginners, a teacher can completely focus on reiterating basic language concepts until they are completely embedded into the mind of the student, and for advanced students, a teacher can completely focus on niche language concepts that would not get the same attention in a group class setting.

                    In a private class, teachers can also tailor lesson plans so that they align with the interests of the student. Language acquisition is far more enjoyable and effective when it is aligned with passions and interests.
