                    Human beings are innately social, and by interacting with each other, we are always learning. The social environment of a group class can make Chinese language acquisition significantly more effective for students. In group classes at the AEI-Intlingo Academy, all students have the opportunity to interact with other students and the teacher in a completely immersive language experience. Instead of simply learning out of a textbook, students can have real conversations in Chinese with other students, they can ask each other questions, brainstorm ideas, and play language games.

                    This style of interactive learning is also supported by qualified and experienced teachers who control the whole experience to ensure that while students are having fun they are also picking up valuable language skills. These classes are perfect for students who wish to learn Chinese in a fun and supportive classroom environment.
