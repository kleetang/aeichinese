                    Many people are busy throughout the day-time, whether that is with a full time job, with other studies, or with looking after a family. That is why the AEI-Intlingo Academy offers Evening Chinese Language Classes for people who are short on time but still want the very best opportunity to learn Chinese.

                    Whether a student wishes to learn Chinese in order to speak the language for an upcoming trip, to speak with Chinese friends and family, or to be able to read Chinese poetry and literature, our evening classes are the perfect option.

                    Our qualified and experienced teachers provide a comfortable and supportive environment that helps our students to develop a range of Chinese language skills, from conversational Chinese to understanding Chinese characters. By using immersive techniques and multimedia resources, our teachers ensure that students develop Chinese language skills that stay with them.
