                    The HSK is an internationally recognized certification in Chinese language proficiency. Many people who wish to study or work in China need to take this test in order to demonstrate their ability for using the Chinese language. At the AEI-Intlingo Academy, we structure classes specifically with the needs of the HSK student in mind to ensure that they are fully prepared for the test.

                    These classes cover Chinese characters, grammar, and sentence structure as dictated by the HSK curriculum. Beyond learning the essentials of the examination content, students who enroll in our HSK Training classes will also develop skills in strategies and techniques for passing the exam.

                    One-on-one classes with qualified teachers ensure that any areas of the HSK curriculum that a student finds particularly difficult can be addressed by the teacher with specially created exercises and teaching techniques.
