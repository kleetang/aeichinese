                    There are many good reasons for adults to learn Chinese. Perhaps a student is planning a trip to China or a Chinese speaking country and requires some fundamental language skills in order to have the best possible experience, perhaps they have friends or family members who speak Chinese and they would like to be able to communicate with them more effectively, or perhaps they have a requirement to speak some Chinese in the workplace and would like to improve their Chinese speaking abilities in the office.

                    Whatever the ability of the student, and whatever the reasons for wanting to learn the Chinese language, the AEI-Intlingo Academy can supply a program that significantly enhances every studentâ€™s ability in both spoken and written Chinese.

                    Our teachers are both qualified and experienced and use a range of teaching techniques that make the learning process both fun and effective. By learning through engaging traditional texts and multimedia resources, students will learn Chinese in an effective way that also provides invaluable access to the rich culture of China.
