                    Weekend Classes in Chinese Language at the AEI-Intlingo Academy are perfect for people with busy working and family lives, but who still wish to acquire Chinese language skills. The demands of a busy job and a large family can often mean that many people only have a few hours to spare on the weekend in which to practice a hobby or learn a new skill.

                    At the AEI-Intlingo Academy, we understand that time is precious and we structure our weekend classes accordingly to ensure that all of our students learn as much as possible from our highly qualified teachers. By learning through a variety of immersive practices such as conversations, games, and learning through multimedia, our weekend classes provide a comprehensive language acquisition experience.
